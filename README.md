This GitHub repository showcases the creation of artistic images inspired by the phyllotaxis phenomenon using R and the ggplot2 package.
The repository explores the beauty of patterns in nature and demonstrates how mathematical concepts can be used to create aesthetic visuals.
It also provides valuable insights into using ggplot2 for data representation and visualization in real-life applications.
